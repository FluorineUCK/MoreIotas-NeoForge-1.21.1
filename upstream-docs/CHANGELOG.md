## `0.1.2` - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- Published MoreIotas to https://maven.hexxy.media.
- Converted Treasurer's Purification into an operator - the item argument can now take either a stack iota or a type iota.
- Made Cave Air and Void Air block types falsy to match normal Air.
- Updated zh_cn translations ([#55](https://github.com/FallingColors/MoreIotas/pull/55), [#58](https://github.com/FallingColors/MoreIotas/pull/58), [#62](https://github.com/FallingColors/MoreIotas/pull/62)) @ChuijkYahus
- Moved certain lang keys for type iotas from Hexal into MoreIotas, since MoreIotas is what actually implements type iotas.
